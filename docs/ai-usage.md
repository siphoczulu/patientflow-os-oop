# AI Usage Statement 

We used AI tools (such as ChatGPT) as a support tool during development.

## How AI was used
- Generating initial scaffolding for some classes (interfaces, repositories, services)
- Suggesting refactors for cleaner OOP structure and naming
- Helping draft documentation and UML in Mermaid format

## What we did ourselves
- Designed the project architecture (packages + responsibilities)
- Implemented the program flow and connected the layers (App → Service → Repository)
- Tested the full workflow manually in the console:
    - lead creation and scoring (HOT/WARM/COLD)
    - filtering and summaries
    - conversion from lead to patient
    - patient listing and search by ID
- Reviewed, edited, and corrected AI-generated code to match course requirements and to ensure we can explain every method

We understand the codebase and can explain the logic, method responsibilities, and design decisions during the presentation.
